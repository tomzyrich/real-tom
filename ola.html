                    <p>A separated soul is a person living a fragmented existence: separated from family, homeland, culture, language and mental environment. Hence, the term separated soul doesn’t necessarily mean the end of life, or death, but it is a separation of the full body while still alive on earth.
                        According to Christianity, the term soul could be traced back to the ancient and very first society where the first man was first created in the Garden of Eden, received the breath of the Almighty and thereafter another being was coined out of his ribs, and souls were connected. This connection has existed since the first creatures’ procreation of the first offspring. Click here to learn about Creation.
                        However, the concept of the soul has been central to various cultures, traditions, and religions used as a signal for the credibility and importance of the existence of every individual. For instance, in Hinduism, the soul is regarded as eternal, which is imprisoned in the earthy body, but at death, Java-atman 
                        (individual soul) passes into a new existence determined by karma. Learn more about the Hinduism culture of soul here.
                        Most people, In the quest to upgrade their standard of living, have been temporarily or permanently separated from their friends and family for so many reasons peculiar to the individual among which include greener pastures, education, tourism, exposure and many more which have caused disconnection and separations among families of those who find themselves in this cubed circle.
                        Mary Joy is a student at SAIT, who felt frustrated because she couldn’t do things she used to do back home, in Philippines. “Change in weather was a major challenge for me, and also fitting in for a good job to pay my bills, I almost regret locating but what kept me going was me holding on to the source of relocating”.

                    <p>Considering also the story of Camille Bartolome, who is a professional immigration consultant at Alma Armada & Company Limited, felt separated from home despite her outward success. “ When I first relocated, it was not easy for me because I came across some challenges, but I have to be focused on the reason I came and look at where I am now, working as an immigration consultant, and in my firm, we counsel people who are at the edge of giving and help them with the right steps to success as a migrated”.

                        However, in both cases, the beginning of healing started when they were being focused on the initial goal for the fragmentation: proper and well-balanced life, relentless work, pressure to fit into society and visual knowledge of how the world outside is. Through mindfulness exercise and focus on the pursuit of achievement, both Camille and Joy gradually begin to return to a proper course of action, finding a new calmness.
                         Psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, trauma and stress-rated disorders are often the physical evidence of this internal separation and fragmentation. Cognitive dissonance, the unbalanced and wrong decisions taken by humans of the critical aspect of the entire life event also depicts how our souls can get divided.
                        Frequent involvement in activities such as self-reflection, exercise, mindfulness, and placing value on healthy self-care is crucial. Building and maintaining a good and supportive relationship is also crucial and is key. A physical or online community also provides a common shared value, purpose and unbiased self-belongings, which can help mend the brokenness of the separated soul.
                        By taking practical steps towards reformation, every individual can begin to heal and consolidate their separated soul. The journey towards entity may not only be possible but achievable in a situation that separates us.
